# Ilesh

I build systems, not just projects.

Currently focused on:
- Backend & APIs (Python)
- AI / ML fundamentals
- Building real products, not tutorials

## What I’m working on
- A personal AI assistant (Jarvis-style)
- Core ML algorithms from scratch
- Web apps with real users and data

## Tech Stack
- Python, SQL
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- React (learning)
- Git & GitHub

## Philosophy
I care about depth, consistency, and execution.
